ImageKill
=========

An extremely simple Chrome extension that adds a button to the toolbar which
will, when clicked, kill all the images on the current page.  Written because
I needed this functionality and wanted to learn a little bit about writing
Chrome extensions.

NOTES
-----

Right now, this just kills images that are in actual <img> elements on the
page.

The ImageKill icon is based on the image-x-generic mimetype icon from the
Tango Icon Library (http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library).  Really,
it's just that icon with a simple X overlaid on it in Inkscape.

TODO
----
* Kill CSS background images
