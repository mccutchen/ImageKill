ImageKill
=========

An extremely simple Chrome extension that adds a button to the address bar
which will kill all the images on the current page.  Another click will
restore the images.

I wrote this because I wanted this functionality and wanted to learn a little
bit about writing Chrome extensions.

NOTES
-----

The ImageKill icon is based on the image-x-generic mimetype icon from the
Tango Icon Library (http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library).  Really,
it's just that icon with a simple X overlaid on it in Inkscape.


TODO
----

* Test this on more pages.  It works pretty well in my own limited use.
